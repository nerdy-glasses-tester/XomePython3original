# XomePython3
Python Selenium Appium Automation Framework using Python 3.7

This is an expanded/modified version of the framework sample used in the Selenium Python3 course I enrolled in at https://www.letskodeit.com/
I'm applying it to the XOME web and mobile app instead of the letskodeit web app.
I expanded the teacher's existing framework to include for Appium mobile automation which the course did not cover.
I only automated some basic negative/positive login test cases. When I have more time I will continue building out more test cases like I did for my Java automation framework.
Thanks.
